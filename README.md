# IDA custom scripts

I will upload here some scripts I made for myself because I needed to do somethings to help my life while learning to use better this software.

To use the scripts, just put them into your %IDA\_HOME%/plugins directory.

# ASM Helper

This scripts I made is used to open up a webpage ([www.aldeid.com](https://www.aldeid.com)) with the info for the current cmd highlighted into the viewer. It will do a double check from the JSON that is a valid command to search up before starting the webpage. Actually just supported only the instruction that are available under x86, and not every function are listed with the infos, but most of.
